# expert-octo-fortnight
This project is, hopefully, a rewrite of the second iteration of the ARISTA website such that it is inline with modern programming standards and frankly, not simply poorly designed.

## TODO
- Figure out roles and permissions in models
  Is there a library that does this
  Just write our own library that does this -- maybe with a login required decorator or something of the sort
- Work out template models for different blueprint
  Work out how different names will work
  Filters that we want for Jinja2 -- put in the proper file
